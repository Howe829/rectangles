# Chapter5 [Using Structs to Structure Related Data](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html)
- How time flies! In this chapter I've learned the struct of rust, we can use struct to group a set of variables or custom defined datatype.
- You will be familiar of struct if you know C's or Golang's.
- Tuple structs without named field.
- Unit-like structs without any fields.
- Define associated methods in "impl" blocks.
